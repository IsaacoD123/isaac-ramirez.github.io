➗ I am a Master's Student of Mathematics at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

🔭 My academic interests are geometry, analysis and finance. I am also keen on computer sciences and physics.

🏦 I am also interested in actuarial sciences and risk analysis.

💪 I enjoy fitness. One of my intellectual passions is how the body works from all perspectives. From the brain to the mechanics.

🇰🇷 I love languages! I am currently learning Korean.

📹 I am also passionate about education and believe that learning begins with oneself. Initiative is the key to success. I created a YouTube project where I shared animated videos about mathematics, using the Adobe Creative Suite and the Python library Manim to produce the animations. Follow me on youtube!
