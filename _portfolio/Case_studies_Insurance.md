title: "Statistical Methods in non-life Insurance"
excerpt: "In this project, I explored Generalized Linear Models and their applications in insurance. Specifically, I computed relativities for tariff calculations using data from a Swedish insurance company. The dataset contains information on more than 64,000 policyholders and their vehicles. After performing statistical analysis in RStudio, I used the glm() function to compute the relativities numerically. This case study is based on the excellent book Non-Life Insurance Pricing with Generalized Linear Models from the European Actuarial Academy. More information and a draft of the project are available in the following PDF (in German)."
